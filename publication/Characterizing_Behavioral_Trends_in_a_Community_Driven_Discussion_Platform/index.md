abstract: This article presents a systematic analysis of the patterns of behavior of individuals as well as groups observed in community-driven platforms for discussion like Reddit, where users usually exchange information and viewpoints on their topics of interest. We perform a statistical analysis of the behavior of posts and model the usersâ€™ interactions around them. A platform like Reddit which has grown exponentially, starting from a very small community to one of the largest social networks, with its large user base and popularity harboring a variety of behavior of users in terms of their activity. Our work provides interesting insights about a huge number of inactive posts which fail to attract attention despite their authors exhibiting Cyborg-like behavior to attract attention. We also observe short-lived yet extremely active posts emulate a phenomenon like Mayfly Buzz. A method is presented, to study the activity around posts which are highly active, to determine the presence of Limelight hogging activity. We also present a systematic analysis to study the presence of controversies in posts. We analyzed data from two periods of 1-year duration but separated by few years in time, to understand how social media has evolved through the years.
